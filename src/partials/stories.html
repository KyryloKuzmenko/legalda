          I was permanently banned from VALORANT for ‘toxicity,’ even though I
          had no prior warnings and never used voice chat. I submitted a
          standard appeal and was denied within minutes. A friend told me about
          LegalDA, and they helped me draft a clear, professional response with
          supporting context. Riot reviewed it again and lifted the ban within
          five days. I’ve never felt more supported in a gaming dispute.

          After a buggy patch ruined my saved progress in Diablo IV, I requested
          a refund from Blizzard, but they rejected it, saying I had ‘too many
          hours.’ LegalDA helped me file a complaint citing EU consumer
          protection law. Within 48 hours, Blizzard reversed their decision and
          refunded the full amount. The team was fast, polite, and knew exactly
          how to handle the situation. I didn’t think it would work, but it did.

          I was charged twice for the same in-game bundle in a mobile game, and
          the app support team ghosted me. Google Play refused to help, saying I
          had ‘confirmed the purchase.’ I reached out to LegalDA, and they
          helped me submit a formal refund request along with screenshots and
          payment proof. I got my money back within three days. It felt good to
          have someone actually advocate for me instead of just sending me links
          to policy pages.

          My Steam account was locked after a payment flagged as suspicious,
          even though it was my own debit card. I couldn’t access hundreds of
          games, and support was giving me generic replies. LegalDA walked me
          through how to document everything and wrote an appeal that finally
          got real attention. Valve responded and unlocked my account after a
          week. Without LegalDA, I’d probably still be locked out.
